## About Me
I'm a software developer passionate about algorithms, data structures, and interactive visualizations. I enjoy turning abstract problems into visual, educational tools that help other learners and developers explore concepts quickly. I contribute to open-source projects, prototype new ideas, and continually learn by building.

---

## Highlights
- ✅ Strong focus on divide-and-conquer algorithms, algorithm visualization, and educational tooling  
- 🌱 Continuously learning modern C++ patterns, performance, and cross-platform UI techniques  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on educational open-source projects and tooling  
- 🚀 Comfortable converting research or classroom material into interactive demos

---

## Top Skills
- Languages: C, C++, (add others you use: e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Visualization & Educational UX
- Debugging, Profiling & Optimization
- Version control & Open-source collaboration (Git, GitHub)

(If you want a polished skills grid or icons, I can add badge/shield links and a tech section.)

## Featured Project
- [Divide-and-Conquer-Visualizer-in-C-](https://github.com/faizan-pervez/Divide-and-Conquer-Visualizer-in-C-) — An interactive visualizer to demonstrate divide-and-conquer techniques and their step-by-step execution (C / C++).  
  - Visualizes recursion, subproblem division, and merging.
  - Helpful for learners to see runtime behavior and recursion trees.

Add more featured projects and I’ll format them with screenshots, demo links, and short highlights.

## What I Build
- Interactive visualizations that teach algorithms
- Small, focused developer tools and utilities
- Prototypes that turn theory (lectures, papers) into hands-on demos

---

## How to Work With Me
- Fork the repo, open an issue to discuss big changes, and submit PRs for bug fixes or improvements.
- I welcome issues labeled `help wanted`, `good first issue`, or `enhancement`.
- If you want to collaborate on a demo or teaching tool — reach out!
